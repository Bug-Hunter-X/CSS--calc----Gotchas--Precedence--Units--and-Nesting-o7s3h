The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes cause unexpected behavior if you're not careful with operator precedence and units. For instance, `width: calc(100% - 20px);` works as expected, but `width: calc(50% - 20px + 10%);` might not calculate as you'd anticipate due to the order of operations.  Another issue is that `calc()` doesn't handle units consistently in all browsers, potentially leading to layout inconsistencies across different browsers.  Also, nesting `calc()` expressions too deeply can cause performance issues and even render errors in some cases.
